# PigMan
 I am the pigman. Be amazed. I devour everything, even the bones, and I leave no trace. But, I also think like an ordinary man who lives in pursuit of his own dreams and ambitions. The pig's hunger doesn't go out of my mind, and the desire to be a rich man influences my decisions as well. Even so, I still feel humanity within me.
